I went through of the effort of designing and making a set of laser cut game organizer boxes for my Mice and Mystics game and thought I'd share it.   It is designed for 1/8th inch (0.125 inch)  material.  I used thin plywood - but MDF would probably work also.   I've included several file formats - SVG and DXF, but it was designed in Corel draw.   My goal was to make a spot for everything, have a couple of removeable trays and also to make sure the result didn't push the lid up at all when done.   Of course, after I had spent all the time designing it - I looked online and found several others that were very nice (better) but this one is free and all the others cost money... so there's that.  :-)
